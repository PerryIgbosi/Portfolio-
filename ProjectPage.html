        <h3>Project 1: Fasten 4</h3>
        <p>
          I worked with a team to develop a Connect 4 game using Java. Our goal
          was to recreate the classic game with a clean interface and smooth
          gameplay. We successfully built a fully functional version, complete
          with win detection, animations, and a credits screen. The project
          strengthened my Java, teamwork, and problem-solving skills

        <h3>Project 2: Business Idea</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at the American University of Nigeria, my team
          developed a business idea focused on helping individuals set better
          prices for their products. The project explored how psychological
          pricing strategies—such as anchoring, decoy pricing, and loss
          aversion—influence consumer decisions and revenue. We created a
          concept that could potentially help small businesses make smarter
          pricing choices.
