      <h2>Employment history</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Although I have not held formal employment yet, I’ve gained valuable
          experience through my volunteer work. In 2014, I volunteered during an
          IT-focused summer program, helping organize events for the Literacy
          Integration and Formal Education Foundation. Through those efforts, we
          raised over ₦100,000 to support underprivileged youth. I also
          volunteered at SHELL an oil company in Nigera, working in the IT
          department in an entrepreneurship role. That experience opened my eyes
          to the vast opportunities within the tech world and strengthened my
          interest in pursuing programming professionally.
